# PulseTrade.Comm.Spa.Dynamic

This project is a dynamic SDUI (Server-Driven UI) and Actor extension for `PulseTrade.Comm.Spa`, built with WebSharper.

## WebSharper Bundle Project & NuGet Packaging Quirks

When developing a WebSharper `Bundle` project (or `spa` project) that is intended to be distributed as a NuGet package, there is an important behavior to note regarding how static assets (`wwwroot`) are packaged and consumed.

### The Problem
By default, when you run `dotnet pack` on a WebSharper `Bundle` project, the compiled JavaScript files and static assets (located in `wwwroot/js/`) are **NOT** placed alongside the compiled `.dll` inside the `lib/<tfm>/` directory of the resulting `.nupkg`.

Instead, they are packed into the `contentFiles` directory, specifically:
`contentFiles/any/<tfm>/wwwroot/js/`

If your server-side F# code (e.g., an extension registration mechanism using `typeof<SomeActor>.Assembly.Location`) attempts to locate these static assets at runtime by looking relative to the DLL's path, it will fail when the library is consumed via a NuGet reference (like `#r "nuget: MyPackage"` or `<PackageReference>`). The DLL will be running from `~/.nuget/packages/.../lib/<tfm>/`, where no `wwwroot` folder exists.

### The Solution
To successfully resolve these static assets when running from a NuGet cache, you must instruct your server code to traverse up the directory structure and look inside the `contentFiles` folder.

Example of how to locate the `wwwroot/js` folder robustly:

```fsharp
let assembly = typeof<ShowcaseDemoActor>.Assembly
let dllPath = assembly.Location
let dir = System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName(dllPath)

// Local development path (e.g., bin/Debug/net10.0/wwwroot/js)
let localJsDir = System.IO.Path.Combine(dir, "wwwroot", "js")

// NuGet cache path (e.g., ~/.nuget/packages/.../contentFiles/any/net10.0/wwwroot/js)
let nugetJsDir = System.IO.Path.Combine(dir, "..", "..", "contentFiles", "any", "net10.0", "wwwroot", "js")

// Fallback logic
let jsDir = if System.IO.Directory.Exists(localJsDir) then localJsDir else nugetJsDir

if System.IO.Directory.Exists(jsDir) then
    // Successfully found the assets, proceed to serve them
    let allJsFiles = System.IO.Directory.GetFiles(jsDir, "*.js", System.IO.SearchOption.AllDirectories)
    // ...
```

By incorporating this fallback, your extension can seamlessly transition between local FSI script testing (`#I "bin/Release/..."`) and remote NuGet consumption (`#r "nuget: ..."`).
